# Contributions
Whereas most groups divide work to individuals and integrate at the end with little teamwork in between, Spirit of Fire heavily relies on teamwork for the design, programming, testing, and deployment. As such, it is difficult to solely award one person contributions for a feature, as other members may have spent a significant amount of time debugging and programming alongside the other member. For each milestone, we assign each member their general task for completion. However, due to our extensive collaboration, ***Unless otherwise specified, we, Caleb Sattler, Danny Lee, Dhruv Patel, Patrick Huang, hereby agree that all members have contributed equally***.
